# Project: Analysis of No-Show Appointments
## by Adegbite Moriam Adesola
The dataset analyzed in this project (Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree first project) contains information from over 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment ([No-show appointments](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments&sa=D&ust=1532469042118000)). A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. The data was cleaned and analyzed to determine the factors that are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment. Specifically, the following questions are addressed:
- What is the overall show up rate?
- Does age affects show up rate?
- Does gender affects show up rate?
- Does difference between schedule day and appointment day affect show up rate?
- Does sms reeceived affects show up rate?
- Does hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism and handicap affect show up rate?
